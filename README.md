# The Wild Oasis Admin ðŸŒ¿

This repository contains the **internal admin dashboard** for _The Wild Oasis_, a boutique hotel offering 8 luxury wooden cabins.

It is fully integrated with the same database and API used by the public-facing guest website, ensuring real-time synchronization between both platforms.
